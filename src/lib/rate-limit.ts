/**
 * @file src/lib/rate-limit.ts
 * @desc tourney's rate limiter: next-kit's fixed-window counters in MongoDB (collection
 *       rate_limits, removed by the TTL index a minute after each window ends), on the tourney
 *       database. The osu! budget (osuBudget in src/lib/osu.ts) shares the collection and the
 *       document shape. A hit can cost more than one (a call carrying several ops counts each). Subjects
 *       are IP subjects or, for signed-in writes, next-kit's userSubject ("osu:<osuId>").
 *       Counting fails open: if the write fails, the request is allowed and the error logged.
