/**

 * @desc The one osu! API client for the server, from @haruhimemoe/osu: client credentials from
 *       tourney's own osu! app (OSU_CLIENT_ID, OSU_CLIENT_SECRET, the same app admins sign in
 *       with), read on first use; every request sends SERVER_USER_AGENT. Every call goes
 *       through osuBudget: next-kit's createBudget, a global fixed window (50 calls a minute
 *       across every instance) and each caller's share (20 a minute), counted in rate_limits;
 *       its gate says no for the rest of a request after its first no, or a counter it can't
 *       write.
