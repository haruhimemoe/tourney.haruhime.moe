/**
 * @file src/lib/db-privileges.ts
 * @desc The start-up privilege check: tourney reads its database user's privileges
 *       (connectionStatus with showPrivileges) and refuses to run when they reach any database
 *       but its own, except read-only access to the databases it's told it may read (the
 *       haruhime.moe hub's "identity": sessions and users). Any write action there counts as
 *       reaching it. Cluster-level resources (like listDatabases) aren't a database and don't
 *       count; an empty db name and anyResource mean every database. A local server without
 *       access control (no user signed in) reports no privileges and passes. It fails closed: an
 *       answer that doesn't say who is signed in, or a signed-in user with no privileges listed,
 *       is refused, since tourney can't tell what that user reaches. The error names databases,
 *       never the connection string. Shared mode (TOURNEY_ALLOW_SHARED_DB_USER=true) allows other
 *       databases with one warning naming them, but still refuses those answers and a user that
 *       can't read and write every collection in tourney.
