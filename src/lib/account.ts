/**
 * @file src/lib/account.ts
 * @desc The browser side of the hub session, from @haruhimemoe/next-kit/auth-react: the shared
 *       `haruhime-signed-in` marker (the hub sets it on .haruhime.moe; tourney reads it, and clears
 *       it only through POST /api/signout), and one page-wide account store with its hook and
 *       RestoreSignedIn. The store asks tourney's GET /api/session only when the marker is there,
 *       once per page load, so anonymous visitors cost no request. Sign-in happens on
 *       haruhime.moe: the header's "Sign in" goes through /signin (a redirect to the hub's osu!
 *       sign-in, back to this page). Sign-out stays on tourney: POST /api/signout ends the session
 *       on the hub server-side and clears the cookies, then the store is told and the page
 *       refreshes (signOutHere, the header's menu and SignOutButton).
